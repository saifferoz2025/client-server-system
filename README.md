## 🧩 Features

- Forking multiple processes
- Threading using `pthreads`
- Client-server message exchange
- Basic order and inventory management simulation

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Ubuntu/Linux
- C++ (system-level)
- Multithreading (pthreads)
- File I/O and Process Handling

## 🎯 Purpose

To understand client-server architecture at the system programming level and practice thread/process control using C++ in Linux.

## 📂 Files Included

- `src/` – C++ source files (client, server, helpers)
